  The previous 32 size which i received the quality was good as expected but it loose completely and the replacement which i received is fit for me and the product quality was not up the mark. Normally fast many year 32 size is best size for me but my first purchase of jean is been confusing  but any way please keep the check.

  Excellent fabric and stitching. The piece I got was manufactured in Bangladesh. I am 5'8"" and the length was just below ankle. Very nice color and finish is superb. However, in spite of being labeled slim fit, the pant is very tight from the thighs downwards. It is more skinny than slim. I returned the item only for this reason.

",3.0 out of 5 stars

  First thing you notice in Jeans is they are way off with the length. you could expect at least 2"" less in length.  These means either for short person or you are okay to wear it above ankle. Are they worth the price? They may be worth for price listed, but not for MRP mentioned. These jeans are thin, in fact almost similar thickness as formals. Could you use it for rough usage like Jean? No, you can‚Äôt. The zipper is cheaper quality so you may have to careful with that while putting a pressure, they may come off. Apart from that, they look like how it is shown in photo (color, stitch, and style). Fit and finish is up to the mark. Unless you are Brand junkie these are not bad jeans at this price.

",3.0 out of 5 stars

  Description is misleading as it mentions both relaxed and slim. In reality it's only Slim fit. Waist is ok, but from thigh to bottom is tight and it's low-rise too, with just a 4 inch zip. It's extremely uncomfortable.STRICTLY AVOID.

  Don't ever buy it. I buied it on 28july and I started using it from my birthday on 12th of september and I used it only once and when it was washed the whole colour of the jean went off. And now it has become so bad that I can't use it anywhere. It is looking very ugly. The second thing that I noticed is that the cloth of jeans are not cut in the correct manner. As u go towards bottom of the jeans the alignment of the legs changes which looks very odd.

  The size of the waist was fine,just as I chose 28 but the length was supposed to be 34-36 but I received it,measured it and the length was 45....So I went to a local tailor to fix the length ....The quality of the product is fine,matches the price but the only problem is the size chart about this company that doesn't seem to get updated with products that displays on the screen..
