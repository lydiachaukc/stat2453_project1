  It's an used pant such a shameful behavior....Saaf saaf najar aaraha hai pant ko dubara colour kiya gaya hai... And the biggest mistake after committing mistake the forgot to change it...Is se achhey toh market may sale waali 300-400 wali pant hoti hai atleast they are not used. Main thing is not about the money. It's all about the trust towards your consumers

  Bought it for my husband, I received the item in good condition. The colours are same as shown. Material is lightweight & stretchable. It seems durable. it did not shrink or discharge colour after wash. It's very convinient in routine life because of light weight.

  Worst Experience - Kindly Amazon should take a look into this.I ordered new clothes for fetival and one day before I received which I cross verified with the  product and it is of different size .I missed the new clothes for festival because of this since I have to return and get the product for the correct fit.This happened to me twice

  The product is rough. It has no perfect finish. If you are looking for some cheap jeans, you may buy it if the price fits your pocket. Mind you, the fabric would make it clear that you are wearing a cheap product.

  This is purely a steal deal, slim fit jeans has a really smart fit. And at this price, it is pretty awesome. The colour is jet black rather than fading black stuff. And quality is pretty much accurate and not low quality. Loved this jeans from Ben martin.

  do not purchase if you are petite (height 5 feet 3 inches or below) it makes your legs look stumpy.

  Been looking for a good pair of black jeans. This fits perfectly and did not need alter the length. Rise is just an inch below the belly button. Am very happy with this product!

  Don't buy. It's not denim. Its a jeggings... Color fades. N looking so cheap. What a cheap brand

  Good fitting. But does not have front pockets.. hence a little inconvenient.

  Fittings are ok. Stock too old for sale. Got 2017 stock and colour went off too much after 4-5 wash.  Now it is worst. It's better u see and buy
