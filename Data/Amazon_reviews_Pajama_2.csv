  The cloth is okay, but the stitches started coming off after the second wash. The entire stitched thread came off at places around the waist and now the elastic is exposed. Very poor quality stitching.

  These are very comfortable to wear. Once you start wearing these pyjamas you will hesitate to wear shorts or trackpant.Size is somewhat bit large. Probably i should have ordered small size rather than medium. So for example if Size 31 fits perfectly choose small size (28-30). I have brought another one small size which just fits perfectly.Thank you Amazon.

  Product is alright with respect to fabric and comfort. But it is torn as shown on photo and both pockets are of different sizes. One is small and other is big. I did not expect it with Amazon most trusted and biggest retailer Clouldtail, a bit disappointed. Anyways, keeping it considering the current situation otherwise...

  I ordered this because it is an Amazon brand and looked quite economical. But then, when the price is 'cheap', there is a ""price"" to pay! The cloth quality is quite average (ie, rough cloth for a loungewear), and thus not very comfortable to wear compared to other well known brands. Also, whatever starch or chemical they have used to process the fabric is quite annoyingly smelly. You will have to wash it a few times to get rid of that smell. Size (the length) is short - when you compare with other good brands. So ordering the next or even next-to-next size may be required. Overall, not a good product. Buy it, if your main consideration is just the price and you are willing to put up with all the discomfort!

  I love these pyjamas! They're soft, comfortable, fit very well, and have excellent quality overall (stitching and material). They look very good too. The fit is just right, relaxed - not to loose and not too tight and super comfortable. In case it matters to you, they have a 2-buttons fly opening.After trying one, I immediately ordered 3 more of these in other colours. I usually use Jockey pyjamas but trust me, these are almost equally good, if not better. The difference in the cost seals the deal (I got these for Rs. 400/- each during the Great Indian Festival Sale while the Jockeys cost a minimum of double this price).I recommend these 100%. Fyi- my experience with the Amazon brands like Symbol and Solimo has always been excellent.

  I have bought this same Symbol Lounge bottoms 4 times. The first time it was 5 stars. White color, now unavailable. 2nd time I bought it on sale reddish color, it was ok, 3 stars. 3rd batch 2 sets of navy blue - ok, but I think the dark dye did not suit my skin and I found it itchy. This is the fourth time - ok again, but looks like the vendor used some tricks to reduce the cloth, so while it fits, it seems smaller. PLEASE Amazon, INCREASE THE PRICE OF YOUR Symbol Brand LOUNGE BOTTOM IN LINE WITH TODAY'S PRICES AND PROVIDE US WITH 2015 QUALITY AND PLEASE SELL **WHITE** VARIANT AGAIN! This would be better than keeping the price low and reducing quality.

  After a long time I have found a lounge wear which is perfect in terms of looks, fit, and comfort!! I have read lot if reviews here before ordering for the first time but after wearing it...most of the reviews I had read is all waste bcoz it is actually very good. Fabric is also not loosing color after multi wash! I initially ordered 1 and fater wearing it, I ended up ordering 4 more. I definitely recommend this product as lounge wear!

  Fast color, good material, wash and wear, blended cotton, great stitching and very good fitting. In fact fitting depends upon one's body. I am a fit person with a normal waistline. I have already bought a similar quality with similar material similar sized pyjama from a well know brand in India for more than double the same price. Go for this Amazon's amazing product. Great value for money.

  Now I really believe in Jockey or nothing. At the original price 999 this is worst, but at 50% less still it is not worth, my advice is please please do not buy. If you are a jockey man, hell noooooo.Fit, quality of fabric are zero. But elastic is good.

  For taller men Medium & even long size will be little short, exactly as shown in the picture with ankle showing. Medium size I got was 28"" waist & length 38"". I tried L but the length is the same. Material seems mixed cotton & is light weight pants. You could find better home wear elsewhere.

  It is really comfortable and fitting was also good for me but it is little bit different from the photo.The product is regular fit not slim fit as shown in photo . Good for wearing it at home but don’t consider it as formal wear as shown in photo . It is good for certain situation only if you are planning to wear it outdoors.

  I've been wearing ""Symbol"" apparels for one year now. Very good thing is they've never disappointed me in terms of quality, price. Seems like a big brand is in building.This Pajama hasn't disappointed me either. Its light on skin, pretty comfortable and looks cool.Bring it on ""Symbol"". Looking forward for more such products under leisure model. Thanks.

  I bought these and a “big US brand” pair pretty much wiring a week of each other. The Amazon pair is 80% of the other pair at perhaps half the cost. The big brand PJs didn’t shrink and are softer. But this is a decent pair. So I’m happy. But!!!  Are they made in India?  Would be a shame if they weren’t.

  Low high , lump is a bit tight,  very discomfort particularly for old person usually habituated to wear long high trousers. Not recommended. It is suggested to make long high and enlarge seam , back portion in order to feel comfortable. Price is too high in comperison to other market . Not useful, complete waste.Thanks.

  These are excellent. Stitching is much better than many branded ones which cost 2-3 times more. There are only two minor things that you should consider -1. Fitting is on the slimmer side. If slim fit clothes typically don't fit you, you can order a larger size and spend 50 rupees to some local cloth alteration shop if its too loose.2. Length is slightly more than required. You might need to get it altered at a local shop.But at the price that they are available, they are a value for money as compared to expensive brands.

  I always order just 1 piece of these Amazon Co-Branded Items to check the fabric material. This one is good.. in the past I had bad experience with one fo the Amazon-CoBranded Product (pajama) Buy without a 2nd choice.

  Length can be a problem for taller men if they want to take it. My waist is 37"" and lenght required for me is 43"". Its length is 41""at time of purchase in unwashed new condition. It will surely shrink by 1.5"" more.other wise it's a ok product quality wise.price also is somewhat more for this small  length. If they can make it 43"" then it would be good. Also button for front is not comfortable for opening it.

  The stitching was defective and unravelled with the first pre-wear wash. Amzon takes no responsibility.Check all Amazon clothes for stitching strength before removing the price tag and return immediately if it is weak or defective.Better still, buy clothing from other eitailers who stock quality apparel.
