  This shoe looks really good (exactly the same as shown in the picture) and the comfort is good too..however my feet size is 10 I ordered number 10 and it was one inch bigger so I ordered for number 9 and guess what it did fit right..Tips: order one size down from your original size

  I normally wear size no 7 so i ordered that size and the shoes that i got was too big for me. There should be universal size that every product needs to follow or atleast amazon should mention the sizes in inches and cm etc so we can atleast get an idea. As a working women i have less time thats why i shop online but what the heck. I am never happy with the product in first attempt of shopping. Kinda fed up with it. üòë

  I bought this by ignoring for the umpteenth time the wise adage, that you get what you pay for. In the pictures it looks mildly reminiscent of the Adidas Superstar. At about a ninth of its cost, and a high average rating, you'd believe this is worth it. Well it's not. I ordered a size 10 (UK), and my toes had some headroom to spare. But what's worse, the synthetic fabric of the shoe warps out of shape as you tie the laces. The edge of the 'tongue' or the inner flap presses against the front of your ankle. There is very little support for the arch of the foot. It was unpleasant, and I decided to return it. Your mileage might very, but I'd rather buy the Adidas Superstar if it's ever on sale or if I feel like splurging five grand. Not this one.

  I've been using these for a while now and recommended to my friends as well. They liked it and wanted me to order and I did the same.This is not a common thing that Sparx is mimicking Adidas Rockstar shoes because they just tried that and although they succeeded a little bit but failed at quality standards. And I'm not saying negative about these shoes because these are so much comfortable and trendy as well but what Sparx can't afford is the quality standards and the feel what the original brand(Adidas) provided with their shoes.Sparx on the other hand provided a very comfortable and fitting shoes. Quality is exceeded my expectations. Materials used are good enough for a longer life. Do give a try if price is a concern because these won't fail to surprise you.

  Product:- Shoes are amazing but the size is literally somewhat larger than normal shoes and the quality of the material should be more improve. Rating 4/5 for qualityFitting:- Size is literally larger than normal shoes, i have ordered 8 number but and i received 8 but its like 9. So think before you the size of the shoes I'll be somewhat larger then you expected.

  First of all , i would like to say it is a great  shoes. i want to highlight some pros and cons of the shoes.Pros :-# Strong sole of the shoes.# Elegant Apperance.# Comfort .# Ajdustable Feature.# Worth Buying ..!Cons :-#Since it is white in colour ,so you have to take care of the shoes very properly.# I got the wrong lace up of the shoes ,which i have to correct it.Overall it is great shoes to buy . i want to rate it 4/5.  i hope this review will help in buying the shoes.

  Quality of shoes is ""fine"" not great, not bad. The upper front part of shoes gets deformed even if slight foot movement so I guess that's the part which is going to ruin the shoes first. There is some colored patch on side of one shoe which is completely disgusting. So I'm not that satisfied with this delivery and product quality. It's better if you buy those same shoes from actual market. The overall packaging was worst! They gave me completely scrambled box.. the sparx bag inside was looking like either used or nearly 4-5 years old! So overall WORST!

  Sparx is a well known brand and is quite reliable if you ask me. I've used Sparx products in the past and was never disappointed with the quality. First of all the price is very reasonable, you won't find anything better in this price range. Secondly, its totally value for money & is a very high quality product. The shoes are light in weight, fits perfectly & provides comfort to the feet. They are good for outdoor activities and you can also wear them casually, they do enhance the overall look of your outfit. The shoes seem strong & durable, if you are going white ones then you'll have to take some extra care to make sure they remain white & shining at all times. I'm happy with my purchase & will definitely recommend it.I bought White in size 10.

  Really nice quality product.Not giving full 5 stars as the shoes is larger then expected. My size is UK 9, shoe size is UK 9. Still the shoe is larger and this not so comfortable to wear.Please buy one size smaller, the shoes is nice just need to take care of size.

  The shoes are a counterfeit and not genuine sparx product.The tongue of the shoe does not bare a sparx logo and the other logos on the shoe get wiped off too.Also there are irregularities in the stitching of the shoe at the front portion.A genuine product is expected when you pay for it.Please check if the product is genuine before buying it.

  Very good and elegant looking sneakers, really has a cool street vibe about it. Fits well, and the sole is really comfortable. It may feel a bit heavy on your toes at first, but overall really impressed with the product. Goes well with casual as well as sports wear.This is what I call value for money. Sparx is a really good brand, and I'm surprised how they're not more of a common household name. Do yourself a favour and save your money by going for this instead of that Nike sneaker you're thinking of buying.

  These are my favorite Fit shoes yet! I wear a size 8 shoe and they fit perfectly.I am absolutely in love with them, and have had so many people asking me about them and commenting on them. They are perfect for my weight training and crossfit routine --My last favorite shoes were my Nike MetCons, and these are now my shoes of choice for exercising. The fit was totally perfect and the support is also just as perfect. Thank you so much!

  First of all im really happy with amazon service, the way they packed it delivered it with box at given time.The product is quite impressive when you wear it with proper outfit , you should know when to wear the black sneakers n when to wear white according to your overall outfit.The product is little more in size, so I would suggest if you use 10 size for your sport shoe go for 9 number size.4/5. Thanks amazon again.

  Product is very good. Buy a size next to yours.In the size chart given on the buying options, they given as 27cm for 7uk size, I measured my foot size and it is 27cm so I ordered 7uk but in the delivered box the size 7uk mentioned as 25cm there is a difference in the measurement given in the Amazon's chart size and original delivery size. Hence it is better to order the next size to yours.Also why it is better to buy the next size is, the front part is little smaller in the show it may give discomforts.So if your size is 7 then order 8 it will be better.

  I ordered size no. 8 in my firstly , and it was too large . And replace with size no.7 ,  delivery was  within 1  day after requesting for replacement . I think there's no better return /replacement facility better than Amazon , I'm really surprised .

  What a superb product from Sparx, just loved the build quality, Comfort, inside cushioning, fabulous design which Feels and looks premium and the best thing about this shoes is that it gives a good confidence while walking on rocky stones, rough and wet surfaces, I did a small adventure on Rocky mountains and I never felt nervous.You can definitely go for this, at this price range it is one of the best you'll get and I'm using Sparx from many years it's all products are very good material.

  got this osom shoe for just 529, where as this shoe costing 750 at a showroom near me.weight is a bit more but looks are great, material of the shoe upper is good enough, sole is made of rubber which may last for a year.i must say, in this cheap pricing it is a value for money deal.overall i'm very much satisfied with the shoe.shoe laces are not upto the mark, but you can easily buy another good quality laces under 30-40 rs.well, with this price range you cant expect more than this shoe deliver.at last, salute to delivery man for following up all the important delivery instructions.

  Good product at 591. The only issue which is partly due to my leg size and partly because of shoe design. My size is 8 but this shoe is designed for long legs, and I have little bit small legals, you may say.I have ordered other Sparx shoe which really fits fine on me but a bit tight for my brother elder. So, finally this shoe fits a bit loose on ankle for people with small legs.But I can manage and I didnt return it as I am I love in with these shoes. Must buy.

  I bought it for 529rs on Diwali offer.This is my second purchase of the same shoe .I already had a white one, and this time, I purchased black.The looks are fine,It can be used for normal occasions, like travel to office, school, colleges, photoshoot etc..Not good for running/trekking..Lasts longer .buy a size smaller . My usual size is 10 ,  last time I purchased size 10,. But it was little loose, so, this time ordered size 9 and it was perfectly fitting.Pro tip : buy one size smaller for Sparx, and one size larger for bata.. üòâ

  Bought for Rs 510. Overall the product quality is satisfactory. The only problem is with the product's front part which tends to create a crease while walking and it might cause the product to deteriorate faster than most of the branded products. using a shoe tree would increase the shelf life of the product.At this price, I would say this is a steal deal. definitely go for it.

  The shoes are really good. Packing and the delivery of the shoes are on time. They really look great and feel comfortable for a short time but when it comes to wear if for a whole day the real problem starts (not exactly a problem) as the shoes are snug and are not breathable which causes sweat in ur foot if you where for a long time. That's it rest the product is just amazing and great deal for this process range.

  A good spare pair of shoes at this price can't go wrong just have toh wash them really often idk what happens but it's like dust just is attracted by the shoe as it is white it may sound weird for me saying it but they aren't in this way like any other white shoes they get way way dirtier way sooner other than that what could you ask for at this price.

  Can be used to pair with any casual wear.One drawback - dirt sticks to it very soon - used it for a couple of weeks and I can see a slight discoloration due to the dirt.It's washable and care needs to be taken while doing the same as the inner sole can get soggy and unusable.

  Great looking pair of shoes and a steal for Rs. 540.  However the fit is slightly larger than normal and the front flap under the laces is a little unyielding and might cause discomfort at the front ankle. Good for walking, haven't tried working out in these or other activites that might subject them to stress.

  Very heavyweight shoes. Both my feet started paining after a use of about 30 minutes casual walk. Still i continued to wear it for a week, hoping the pain would go away. But it did not. Then I applied coconut oil inside the shoes, and finally the pain subsided. Now after a month's use, my toes sometimes pain. But not always. So I feel feel one should avoid buying these shoes even though the price is really tempting.

  I was astounded with the number of positive reviews for this pair of shoes. For someone who is a big fan of original Adidas shoes,this is a big big let down. I don't know why I ordered these in first place,maybe I had a stroke or something or I was sleep shopping. Not worth it! Good thing is that the shoes are returnable. I am happy with the hassle free return of Amazon.

  Likes:1) Perfect Fit.2) Good packaging.3) Sturdy.4) It has an elevated sole so that the wearer does not get flat foot.5) Eye Catching.Dislikes:1) The Sewing is uneven at some places.2) Low quality laces.3) Can't run wearing these, else you'll damage the shoes or crease then badly.5) Needs frequent cleaning (I have the white model).6) Anaerobic! Feets get sweaty and it gets very hot inside the shoe. Absolutely unsuitable to be worn without socks.Overall: Great product. Value for money.

  Seller sells the duplicate products openly as a original product. you can see that Left shoe Sticker of Sparx is gone. if it was original product then even if shoes torn the logo remains. important worrying thing is Amazon Support as well as Escalation team doesn't care about Customers once the product is sold. even after emailing to grievance officer no use.

  Not that comfortable to wear in first attempt but might get better with time, quality wise it's okay not too good not too bad, slightly hard and heavy at the same time, the fit is bit tight at the start.. Finishing is not that put to the mark but yeah it's durable and strong, quite satisfied with the purchase.

  Good Product for casual use.White colour variant gets dirty very quickly which is only the cons.Otherwise looking at its design & brand, you should buy it by closing eyes.Packaging of the product was good but the box of Sparx was broken which disappointed while opening the package.Also I didn't get the Receipt of the product in the package...

  this shoe is best for school life guys but if you wear 9 no. shoes you buy this shoe for 8 no. bcz it is bit larger than normal. and main point is if you buy this shoes in white color then bro! care is more important bcz too much dirt in white. and the last advise is you always wear this white shoes to black pants or black jeans dont match up with any color except black

  This is a great shoe at 600rs price point. It is not premium looking by any means but this does the job. There's a rubber like material in the middle where it bends while walking, that is a nice thing. Cushions inside are decent enough. Although I won't recommend these to wear all day b'coz it's not breathable; no breathable holes like Adidas superstars. Can't compare to adidas superstar and can't complain that with 1/10th of the price.

  There is no doubt about the quality of shoe as it was exceptionally well when it comes to material quality, design, looks and fit. I got it in an offer and I'm really satisfied.

  Good for this price range, design is similar as in higher brands like nike.One thing to consider is this shoe doesn't have mesh/net in it, so no breathing space for your feet.In summer you will get sweaty feet. For winter it is OK.

  The built quality is just okay, you shouldn't expect the 'Sparx quality' in this product. Also the sole of the shoe is pure white but the upper material is somewhat off-white, so within 1-2 months of use they won't be matching each other! Laces are terrible!

  The color appears blueish on online but the real product is greenish  . The material produces heat so couldn't wear,  size taken is 9 longer by 3 CM,  but width wise it fits OK. So 9 should be OK. Style is OK with the price. Only reason to return is heat.

  The Shoe looks good ....  however this could be an Overrun or an Irregular from the factory run, as the Size is way too small for 9 UK size that is mentioned in the label. I compared with my existing 9 UK size Sports Shoe and this one is small in size by more than 1 inch. Looks like they have put this item under a Discount due to this.  So, pls be careful while ordering any discounted items.

Finishing is bad.After 1 month of average 1 hr daily usage of normal walking shoelaces holes have started widening tearing holes in to the shoe.Very bad quality!

  Worst (incomplete) packaging the shoes came alone in a amazon wrapper without the shoe box. The next thing is shoe quiet large also it doesn't fits me well actually it is loose. I ordered uk7 size shoe i don't know why it looks like uk8 no shoe. Apart from that shole quality is not good the red part which i thought would be a red shole but it is actually a black with red paint, which is also not done well you can easily see the it's black one with red paint.

  Review after a week of usage:I was initially hesitant to buy running shoes from here, but due to budget constraints here we are. The look is really good for this price and it is pretty comfortable to workout in. I found the fit a bit too tight at the beginning but after a running session it was alright. You'd be surprised by how good they are! Bought it for 599, totally worth it.

I ONLY WANTED TO STICK TO GOOD BRANDS LIKE PUMA, LOTTO, OR AT LEAST SPARX. BUT THIS SHOE CAUGHT MY EYES AND WANTED TO TRY MY LUCK AND ORDERED IT FOR 549. I MUST SAY THAT IT EXACTLY IS AS SHOWN IN PICTURE, AND IS AWESOME COMPARED TO THE PRICE. THE SOLE IS OKAY, and THE SOFT MEMORY FOAM INSIDE IS A BIT TOO SOFT, SO OVERALL COMFORTABLE. My size IS 9, BUT IT'S LIKE 9.4 OR SOMETHING..NOT TIGHT, BUT WITH SOCKS, IT WILL BE PERFECT FITTING.

  Pros: light weight, comfortable, good fitting, can be used for walking on smooth tracks/raod.Cons:1.  I have replaced it for its faulty lace eyelets. It's eyelets are not crafted fine as other brands due to which fiber from lace stuck into it. Same issue is also found in replaced shoes but it's slightly less.2.  2nd issue is it's tongue. Foam fitting inside tongue of one shoe is not good. It seems that more foam is stuffed inside it, beyond it's normal capacity.3.  I think it's sole is too soft to run, walk on rough ground, road or track. It's sole would easily scrubbed/wear out on rough surface while running or jogging.

  After having a bitter experience with Asian shoes purchased about three months back, thanks to Amazon for these shoes which are really very comfortable for walking. If slight improvements are made by the manufacturer, these shoes are Comparable with Skechers make being sold in the range of ‚Çπ5000/-. It is recommended being the best walking shoes at this affordable price.Now after almost five months of regular use, I am adding this experience. Shoes are very comfortable and helped in making walking as a habit. The quality of inner lining cloth should have been better as it has started wearing it out. If this lining quality is improved, then you don't need Skechers shoes.

  Awesome shoe - Reducing my rating to 3 start after 4 months of usageSuperb shoes for walking and running in this price range. I got them for 600 INR and considering this price, believe me it can't be any better than these.Main thing that I liked is they are very light weight. You don't even that you are wearing shoes :)After using it for 3 days, I ordered another pair of shoes for my dad and he is also completely satisfied.If you are looking for a shoes which are light weight and comfortable, just go for it !!!******* Review updated after 4 months of usage ******I have reduced my rating to this product to 3 star after using them for 4 months.I used these shoes for almost 4 months. Right after using them for around 2 and half months the sole underneath started getting worn out and  pretty clearly see hole (not see through) getting formed under the thumb area and I felt lot of difficulties while wearing these shoes when I go for a walk as small stones use to gather in that area (not from the bottom) and I was unable to walk. Every time I need to take out the shoes and clear the stones.So overall if you want to use this this product for daily walk, you hardly might be able to use them for 4 months.Anyways if you are a serious walker you need to buy another pair of shoes after 4 months as you can't use them for a longer period, so think twice before buying them.But if you are using them only for office or daily usage (no much walking) then you can buy these shoes.Latest update -It started giving heel pain too, as well started getting holes at the bottomFinal Verdict -Use these shoes only if you want them for regular use but for sure not for walking or jogging !!!HAPPY BUYING !!!

  First of all, I would like to make it clear that what I have outlined in the following review is my personal experience.1. At first I liked about the shoes that company does not cheat on this pair. You get the same shoes in the box as shown in the photos.2. The shoes are very comfortable and Light weight, as the co., says in the description.3. The quality of the shoes is also very good at this price.4. You will find the right size of shoes for your feet, Which is really good.5. The packaging of the shoes also good.6. The design of the shoes is also elegant, you can wear it in any casual dress.7. There is also the great choice for running. It is very light weight so you can run easily and fast.I Finally loved these shoes. Which was what I expected. Suggestion: If you are looking for a great quality and stylish shoe at an affordable price, this shoe is for you.

  After a long research I went for this shoe. Normally I wear Size 10 shoes but in a review I saw someone bought a size lesser & it suited him perfectly , so took the risk & ordered size 9 instead of 10 & surprisingly it fitted perfectly ! The shoe is too well built, very comfortable, You won't feel your legs heavy after wearing this & mostly the experience after wearing is too good , very soft material inside. I bought it for every morning running practice. Lets see how long it survives. I will update this post after afew months usage. You can definitely go for this product. I bought it for 599 + 50 Amazon Pay Cashback so 549 rupees Effectively.

  Everybody complained about the size of the product but still, I bought my regular size. it was not a big issue for me.I agree with the fact that it is a bit large than the expected fit but loose or unusable it's just 2 mm longer than my regular size.lightweight and good for walking.not good for hard use.Wear and tear of the sole is quick when used for running.the paint on the sole is also getting peeled off slightly.But still, this is a great buy due to the quality and the memory form used.

  I am writing this review after using these shoes for around 5.5 months. When I bought it , it felt good on feet and shoes was comfortable to wear nd light weight. Inner cushion felt good but sometimes felt wobbly while walking. But no complaint there. But after using them for walking for about 4 km a day (mostly on nature trails on hills near my house), its sole got almost flat... then I checked and found that its sole is made up of ethylene vinyl acetate which  seems to have very less abrasion resistant. Now when it rains, I feel of slipping on very small layer of mud on road as shoes has almost lost its grip on the ground below. So please think about it before buying this shoe.

  The shoes look awessome beautiful color soft to feel lightweight comfortable to wearWould have been better if it fitted slightly tighter and if had a larger tongue(checkout what is the tongue of a shoe).One more thing ....soles are soft cushioned but needed to be little more firm.Overall nice bargain as u have plenty of shoes costing more than this one without even having half the comfort.

  This shoe is awesome, I got more comfort than any branded shoes, better than CROCS in terms of the cushion. Its really bouncy and very nice feel to the foot. The quality is outstanding. I liked the fine details and the finish of the shoe. Worth more than the money! One set back, though my right size is 9, I had to order 8, since number 9 was a bit larger than the usual. So you can take that chance. I had to replace and get 8 size, which was delivered very next day.

Itss too soft cotton nd fixed at toe so that you have no need to adjust inner sole again and again.2nd imp thing is shoe lace... Its grip is also good.And as the common requirement of most of pplIts light weighted as well... So guys its really worthy and affordable as well. I loved it üòç

  Extremely cheap quality product. Barely used for 10 day and the sole has gotten flat and mesh has too many scratches which is not from daily wear and tear. My honest opinion is not to buy this shoe unless you're extremely rich and only travel by car because if you walk on road you'll not have a shoe after 10-15 days. 3 Amazon return person think I have used this product for years. The poor quality of adhesive is completely gone and the sole is already coming apart from the shoe.Humble opinion is never buy this shoe. Not because what happened to me. But the product is honestly very cheap and you could instead spend 50-100‚Çπ more and get some excellent product. And I sincerely think this is not the product for Amazon recommended page.

This is my second purchase for the same product. Don't think twice and go for it if you want a pair of shoes at lesser price. If you want such quality but with a top brand name you have to spend about INR 1800/- which I think is not worth it. I can have 3 pairs of Asian shoes instead at that price and still can save money.

  They could have spent 5-10 paise per pair to paste the insoles properly.  They are pasted from the heel side but not on the toes ide.  Every time you take off the shoe, the insoles come out from the toe side.  Then you have to wrestle with the insoles to put then back into place in order to prevent them from folding up.

Behaving like a cushion with very less resistance and durability. For me it's a useless product as I wanted a shoe for real running. Price is fine @495 after discount

  Fit is bit tight for size 8. I have had purchased other shoes in the same size and oddly I had 3 different fits. If you wear size 8 shoes then I recommend going for 9.

  Extremely poor product. You can see the image. The sole came out. Just have the good look else everything is waste of money. I don't recommend it to buy.

  Bought a RED pair of shoes (size 8) for son and he loves it very much. light weight, exact red color as shown in images, good grip while running. Good product at reasonable price on par with reputed brands from BOURGE. Amazon delivered this very next day from the ordered date

  The product is neither bad nor too good. The quality of the shoes for the given price range is justified.Gonna use it for playing. Will update as time goes by..Update: It's too good!! I don't wanna use it for playing anymore. Will use it for casual use.

  1.I liked the idea of sponge using under the foot in order to ensure comfort.And the overall quality is good as per the cost.2.The only problem with online order of most of the shoes is they can't be correct to the size.And if one shoe fits to your leg then other can't.It may be an illusion thing or something but I always feel there is some difference in size between two shoe.

  I m using this shoes for last 4 months and its  going good. Only a small issue found is  when you walk for a while shoe pad comes out of the shoes.

  Shoe's length is great but the space where upper part of foot is (under lace) is too tight. This is because my foot is a bit wider. Would have given 5 starüåüif it was a complete fit. But build and packing was gud

  Wasn't sure about the quality but the product is of superior quality.Especially for those who have issues like Plantar fasciitis or ankle injury and are looking for cheaper option to memory foam.100% recommended to buy.

  Nice pair of shoes and has a comfortable sole. Great for daily use, gym and jogging. Reason why I am giving 4 star is the packagin lookg. The packaging was damaged and was like the product was returned and immediately sent to me.
