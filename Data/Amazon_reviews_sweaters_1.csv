  Garment is warm and fit for wearing as an under jacket sweater, the high neck is the usp, it fits perfectly well, length is just right, can leave it hanging or snug inside jeans pant. Overall, a very good value for money

  Put in normal water, not in washing machine. Use Easy wash liquid (just for prevention and good aroma). DO NOT USE IRONING MACHINE. LET IT DRY AFTER WASH. KEEP IT FOR SOME TIME. THEN KEEP IT OUTSIDE TO DRY.

  This is my first time ordering clothes online and therefore, I was extremely worried. But this is awesome. It fits perfectly and the fabric is smooth, neither too thick nor too thin. I examined it thoroughly and found no tear, hole or loose threads either. It stretches too.EDIT Ordered a couple more, but of M size this time. Just as perfect and of excellent quality. Honestly, I can't tell the difference between the S size and M size.

  First off, This colour is pure red. I dont think they know what colour ride wine looks like. I dont mind spending 1k but atleast give me same colour. This product is not slim fit, i only wear slim fit so i know, from the arms side yes its tighter than usual but thats about it. its loose on the front, definitely not what u call slim fit.

  It's material is not 100% COTTON as has been specified in specification. The  specification claims 100% cotton product but it is made of 60% cotton and 40% polyester. See the images. It is annoying that AMAZON is displaying wrong product description. I don't know whether it worth buying at Rs 1019.  Stop AMAZON from such MISGUIDING.

  This review is not based on usage. Fitting is perfect and the colour is as shown in the pic. Don't go for a larger size. But it is not for very cold places where temperature dips below 10 degree centigrade.

",5.0 out of 5 stars

  It fits well and looks very good. It doesn't look baggy and maintains a good shape with the chain both open and close. The color is bright but not too much. It also warm enough to wear around the house and outside. I personally use it when going for jogging, football or gym. I like it and you most probably will.

  Bought this product in Great Indian Sale @‚Çπ850/-. They are selling minor defective / rejected pieces. Ordered Size L initially which was tight for me, so exchanged for XL but it was lose. In L size piece the zipper was getting stuck near the bottom and In size XL there is a visible defect in the inside of the product (see attached pics). There were arrow stickers marked on the defect line in the clothing (which in clothing quality terms mean here is the defect). It is probably a quality rejected piece, so going out in sale at lower prices. Seller should be honest atleast in tagging this as refurbished piece.

  The size of this product is not at all accurate. I got a smaller size product than the one which I booked considering the size chart given in the site.However, the product is a great one. It keeps you warm enough and the material used is of quite good quality.

  cloath quality is poor , you will get bubbles on this very soon plus when you will wear it on any white shirt it will leave imprints on that shirt and will make the shirt black. Only good is that its warm.

  Just about perfect- cost colour material and fit. Fit at chest and length is just about what I expected for Medium also soft machine washable cotton- perfect to use while driving or flying. Cotton hoodie so don‚Äôt expect to work anything below 16 degree c I guess.

  Perfect fit. Material seems to be of good quality. Worth  INR894/-. Better to go for this than settling with local brands to save a couple of hundreds. Have been looking to buy a sweatshirt of late. Was confused with the brands and worth the spend till finally choosing this one. Happy with the product.

",5.0 out of 5 stars

  The sweatshirt arrived in a good package and in good condition. The fit is as expected and quality seemed good. But after one wash the color went off and fabric also became a bit rough. This is not the quality we expect from AS brand.

  It is just like a normal sweatshirt. Instead of spending over 1000 rs on this I'd suggest you to buy any other cheaper sweatshirt for around 500 - 700 rs. That will offer you great value for money.  This one will not be useful if temperature dips below 20
