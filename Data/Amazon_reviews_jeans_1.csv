  This product is not relaxed jeans which is not suitable to me. It is not comfortable at thighs. I don't like shaded Jeans. I perchased blue and light blue jeans last month which is very comfortable to me without shades. So I ordered this one.

  Any good jeans today cost no less than 800 and this is definitely priced low for the quality sold. Good fabric, stretch and fits neat. Must buy for the price. The product images show it to be skin tight but it is comfortable as stated in the product specs.

  Not a best buy, should be made elastic. Design is good but what good will you get if u can't wear it comfortably

  The jean is of superb quality. Totally value for money. But this appears to be a 'Slim Fit'. So if you are planning to buy, buy a size larger than usual.

  quality is not good and chain and button is not work properly and it is seem that it is already used..please be careful about those matter and I want to attract the attention of Amazon authorities in this matter

  Unfortunately the Jean's was a good pair but it's thickness or fit was too tight for me.Being a person of 90's, I do not subscribe to a tight fit when ordering regular size.The waist  size fits perfectly as per order.

  The first thing is that this jeans is not a relaxed fit ... The pattern is more like skin tight fit.... & it's horribly tight on your calves..... Secondly the fabric is so light and rubbery...... That's why i returned it on next day.

  Last month i purchased this BEN MARTIN Jeans, to be very frank i found fitting is really awesome & fantastic, but in terms of quality not upto the mark. The COLOR which they ve use in Jeans is very very much bad & its going to fade sooner, since every time i m washing it the color z getting out from Jeans z very much disappointing. So its lasting is not too much.Its an use n throw product it seems.Company fully should focus on quality.In my last comment i ve given on excitement but Truth will come out after 2 & 3 washing of this BEN MARTIN Jeans.

  Quality of the product is ok ok.... In product they have mentioned high waist but after wearing it's mid waist jeans.After looking at the jeans quality seems it will last only for 3-4months.Price charged for the product is good but compared to other brands questions comes on quality.I have recieved different brand jeans.i ordered tyffyn and I received hovac
